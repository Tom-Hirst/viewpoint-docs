---

Viewpoint will allow you to schedule content to appear during a specific window of time. This is particularly useful for embargoed or time sensitive content such as events.

## Available From

Using the 'Available from date' option will allow you to publish content now, but it will remain hidden until the date and time you specify.

1. [Create](create) or [Curate](curate) your content as you would normally without clicking `Submit for Approval` / `Publish Button`
2. Click the clock icon to the right of the `Submit for Approval` / `Publish Button`

4. Click `Submit for Approval` / `Publish` 

## Expiry

Using the 'Expiry date' option will allow you to publish content now, and it will be automatically hidden from the date and time you specify.

1. [Create](create) or [Curate](curate) your content as you would normally without clicking `Submit for Approval` / `Publish Button`
2. Click the clock icon to the right of the `Submit for Approval` / `Publish Button`
