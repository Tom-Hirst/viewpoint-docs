:::tip[Add Content]
Simply add content by either curating it from your favourite source, automatically aggregating RSS and/or Youtube feeds or just creating your own original content directly in your admin panel.
:::

:::tip[Matchmaker]
Viewpoint matches your content with the right users, based on the tags that you select, and the filters that each user has selected in their preference centre. Viewpoint then schedules notifications to be sent at the right time, by the right method to the user, again, based entirely on their individual preferences.
:::

:::tip[Distribution]
Viewpoint then sends custom notifications to each individual user informing them that your new content exists.
