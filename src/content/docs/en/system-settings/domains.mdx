Dependent on your Viewpoint configuration you may only allow access (whitelist) to certain domain names, alternatively you may have excluded (blacklist) access certain domain names.

> Example:
>- If 'alloweddomain.com' is added to your whitelist, all users with email addresses under this domain E.g user@alloweddomain.com will now be allowed to register
>
>- If 'blockeddomain.com' is added to your blacklist, all users with email addresses under this domain E.g user@blockeddomain.com will not be able to register
